# atctheme

This is a Bootstrap-based Jekyll theme that I designed for use with [my website](atctwo.net).  I've published it on GitHub in case anyone else wants to use it, or is curious how it works.

More details on how the theme was made can be found on [this post](https://atctwo.net/posts/2023/05/18/new-site.html) on my website.

# Pagination

This theme is designed to be used with a paginator (either [jekyll-paginate](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-paginate) or [jekyll-paginate-v2](https://github.com/sverrirs/jekyll-paginate-v2)).

To use v1, just add `paginate: <posts per page>` to your `_config.yml`.  The paginator options are detailed on [Jekyll's website](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pagination/).

If you're using v2, there are [a lot more options](https://github.com/sverrirs/jekyll-paginate-v2/blob/master/README-GENERATOR.md) you can set.  Check out atctwo.net's _config.yml to get an idea of what I used.
