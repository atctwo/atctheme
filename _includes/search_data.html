<!-- this file contains a JSON object which basically contains every bit of text in the entire website, in a structured format.
the idea is that it can be used with searching libraries (eg: lunr.js).  it's automatically generated by jekyll during the
build process.  see the source at https://github.com/atctwo/atctwo.github.io/blob/web4/_includes/search_data.html -->
